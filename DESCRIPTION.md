## What's in this modpack?

This modpack is a Tech modpack intended to give you a fast start with hard, expensive tech mods.

Buffed oregen, move/jump speed options, wallclimb, fast run speed/dodge, attack tweaks, and also added increased enemies, stronger enemies, and options to improve health and defense.

This modpack loads in around 3 minutes and can be run on about 3GB of RAM.

This modpack is centered around GregTech with a largely unmodified tech tree, but with alternative power and resource gathering options to speed up boring grinds.

This modpack has quests intended to guide the player through many tech trees in mods, and an in-game guide explaining gameplay and control changes.
