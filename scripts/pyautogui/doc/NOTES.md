# Notes about pyautogui MultiMC Testing

"xvfb with mesa should work on linux"
"actually I remember reading a post about dolphin's rendering testing automation, that might have some useful ideas"

- Use AWS/Jenkins VM/Bare metal Jenkins and poll main branch to see if modpack would work
- VM with VBox Guest Additions and DirectX support for OpenGL...
    - No OpenGL. This means no main menu. But, forge loading screen shows.
    - I can ditch the check for main menu IF it's detected that a VM is being used...
    - Then look for a black screen,
    - Then look for the string `Forge Mod Loader has successfully loaded (...) mods` in `C:\tools\MultiMC\instances\<NAME>\minecraft\logs\latest.txt`
    - Then loading is done for non-GPU instances.
    - Also, save the log in Jenkins.

- AWS pricing for GPU is garbage, cheaper to buy another PC
- Azure pricing for GPU is garbage, cheaper to buy another PC

## VirtualBox Jenkins Modpack CI/CT Notes

- You don't need a GPU. Minecraft will start black. The script takes this into account.
- 2 Processors
- 5120MB RAM
- 256MB of VRAM
- No 3D Acceleration
- VBoxSVGA Graphics Controller
- Give Minecraft ~4GB RAM
- You must log into MultiMC.
- Disable VBox Guest Addition mouse integrations.
- SET PIPENV_SKIP_LOCK env var to True

### But Jenkins runs as a service! It doesn't have a display!

That's right. You need to turn a Windows User who's logged on into a slave that Jenkins uses to build.

Download slave agent JNLP from (URL may be different):

<http://localhost:8080/computer/gui%20slave/slave-agent.jnlp>

### Other Jenkins VM Tweaks

#### Auto login

    netplwiz

#### Auto run slave-agent.jnlp

-   Download JNLP file
-   Open Task Scheduler
-   Make task with command `slave-agent.jnlp`
-   Set task to run on login
-   Restart and test

#### Etc

## Build Commands

If any of these exit other than exit code 0, or take >30 minutes, fail the build.

Poll SCM every 30 minutes.
